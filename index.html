				<h2>Who I am and what I'm good at</h2>
				<p>I’ve heard that at age 25 the brain is supposed to be fully developed so, having just celebrated my 25th birthday in January, I feel prepared to answer this question. I would say that I am combination of a lot of (sometimes contradictory) things. My favorite colors are black and rainbow. I can meticulously plan a project or jump right in and start testing different ideas. You might find me on the edge of a group just listening or in the middle telling a story. My music collection is equal parts Pet Shop Boys and Led Zeppelin and I might be watching anything from Battlestar Gallactica to The Bachelor (except sports). </p>

				<p>But most of all, I’m curious and love making and learning new things. I’m persistent and become deeply committed to mastering a certain craft or acquiring a skill. I’m happiest when I can experiment and work in both the physical and digital realm, from weaving with yarn to web development. I spent four years in architecture school making tiny buildings out of paper, plastic and metal, accidentally gluing cardboard to myself and learning how to use all the woodshop tools and technology that I could. This past year I have taken several classes in web design and front-end development after work. There I learned how to make responsive websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript and publish them with Github like <a href="http://katiecullinan.github.io/Cville-Coffee/" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://katiecullinan.github.io/doughboys/" target="_blank">this</a> (which also reflect my dual interests in coffee and donuts). When combined with my skills in creative thinking and problem solving my experience with model building, illustration and web and graphic design allow me to quickly express an idea over a wide variety of media. I work at a small marketing and PR agency where I am the “Creative Services Specialist”, which mostly means that I am the whole creative services department/the only one with a Mac. I do everything from web design to video editing to illustration. This has made me great at handling multiple dissimilar projects and prioritizing deadlines while integrating the feedback of others with my own ideas.</p>

				<h2>Where I've lived</h2>
				<p><h3>New York, New York</h3>
				Here I learned to walk and talk and color. I enjoyed a short career as a gender-bending baby model where I was first introduced to the world of advertising. You may remember me from a 1991 Fisher Price ad, I played a boy in overalls. We moved to the Long Island when I was four but I can still weave through a crowd like a champ.</p>

				<p><h3>Rockville Centre, New York</h3>
				I grew up in this small, dense suburb of Manhattan that is home to more Irish pubs than people. Being about 30 minutes from New York gave me access to an extremely diverse and creative community where I could explore different cultures, art, fashion, music and food. I think this has taught me how to communicate with and work with all kinds of people and be adaptable and open-minded.  I also didn’t learn to drive until I was 22 and I say “talk” like it has a “w” in it. </p>

				<p><h3>Charlottesville, Virginia </h3>
				I came to Charlottesville to study architecture at UVA where I learned to speak a little slower and use power tools on zero hours of sleep. The architecture school was a small close-knit community within the university. I was always surrounded by wonderfully talented teachers and students who challenged me to become a better designer and thinker. There were countless late nights and lots of coffee but also a real sense of community within the school. Everyone helped each other produce their best work.</p> 
				<p> After graduation I started working as a graphic designer at Gropen, Inc., a small design/build company in downtown Charlottesville that makes signs, museum exhibits, plaques and other kinds of environmental graphics. There, I participated in all stages of a collaborative design process and became a more creative and strategic designer. I learned a great deal about effective signage, user experience, fabrication methods and how to convey the client’s message.</p>
	
				<p><h3>Washington, D.C.</h3>
				After living in Charlottesville for a little over a year after school I decided to move to D.C. for a new job opportunity and a bigger city. I currently work at a boutique marketing and communications agency creating websites, videos, infographics and collateral pieces. Working in small, creative and deadline driven companies has taught me time management, organizational and team-working skills as well as adaptability and critical thinking. As the only designer in a small company I have a lot of responsibility which can sometimes be stressful. This experience has made me better at solving problems when time and resources are limited as well as realizing when I need to ask for some help. 
</p>
				
				<p>D.C. has also taught me to be very suspicious of Craigslist roommates. </p>

				<h2>How I got here</h2>
				<p>My path to the Brandcenter evolved from what led me to study architecture in college, wanting to create useful and beautiful environments and tools for people.  I want to go to the Brandcenter because I resolutely believe it is the best place for me to learn the skills I need to craft engaging and memorable experiences for users by combining design, technology, and branding. To use design and technology to solve problems. I am passionate about creating designs and experiences that are inviting, clear and enjoyable to look at and use.  I think that making a building is similar to designing a website or an app in that you are creating a framework for people to use and explore but you cannot totally control how or if they will use it so it’s important that it be appealing and simple to understand. </p>
				<p>I want to build things that will allow users to have a unique experience with a brand or product through technology. People carry around libraries, movie theaters, radios, atlases and sketchbooks everyday and all on one device that is infinitely customizable to their tastes. I want to be able to reach people where they are but also educate and expose them to new things; to connect digital experiences with physical ones because everyone could do with some time away from the computer.</p>

				<h2><b>The Principles of Uncertainty</b> by Maira Kalman</h2>
				<p><u>The Principles of Uncertainty</u> is a collection of illustrations and stories that is part diary, sketchbook, travelogue and picture book for adults. To me, it’s about happiness and appreciating the world around you, noticing the little and seemingly insignificant details. Kalman will draw a hat or fruit plate that she saw, making them special and important.  This books lets you see the world through someone else’s eyes and it’s someone who finds delight in abandoned chairs on the sidewalk and old whistles. </p>

				<p>She also describes strangers she sees in the street, inventing little personal histories for them. This resonated with me as a people watcher because it made me think about how I pass by so many people everyday and they're all thinking their own thoughts and have their own problems and goals but I'll probably never know anything about them. </p>

				<h2>How I've failed</h2>
				
				<p>Two years ago I applied to the Art Direction track at the Brandcenter and I didn’t get in.  I chose Art Direction because I had been working in design and I thought it would be a good fit. I put a great deal of effort into the application and was asked to re-submit part of it but, I was ultimately rejected. At first I was very disappointed and upset but I decided I would start looking for a new job to get more education and experience that way. I soon found a new position in D.C. with more design responsibility and I started taking classes in web design and development at night through the Corcoran College of Art and Design and General Assembly. Although going to class after a full day at work wasn’t always what I wanted to do I learned a tremendous amount. I was also truly passionate about what I was learning so it didn’t feel like a chore. Getting rejected pushed me to reexamine my goals and as I learned more about technology and experience design I realized that was the track I wanted to pursue.  </p>

				<h2>Alumni stalking</h2>
				<p>Looking at the portfolio sites of CT graduates has definitely become a hobby of mine these past few months. I think what has impressed me the most is the wide range of exciting projects that they worked on while in school and the variety of job titles that they went on to hold. I’ve seen Experience Designers, Interactive Designers and Art Directors, Filmmakers, Copywriters and more. This is incredibly appealing to me because I would be able to use the combination of technology, strategy, design and innovative thinking taught at the Brandcenter to forge a unique and rewarding career path for myself. </p>

				<h2>Improving with the Internet</h2>
				<p>Something that I do most days is drive my car since I live in an area of DC without a Metro stop close by.  Wherever I’m driving to there is always the same issue – parking. If I have a doctor’s appointment or am going to meet a friend I know to allocate an extra 20 minutes or so for finding a parking space.  On the weekends most street parking is free so there are usually very few spots available (and I’m a very insecure parallel parker).</p>

				<p>How this situation could be improved with the Internet is with an app or device that uses GPS to help you find a parking spot. It would be able to tell you where there are spots on the street open and where there are parking garages nearby (and their prices). It would also tell you where parking meters are about to expire; there is already a system that allows you to pay for metered parking on your phone through an app called Parkmobile. This could also become a feature to layer onto Google Maps like the traffic or bike paths. </p>

				 <img class="modal-pic2" src="img/parking-app.png" alt="Parking App" width="700px">

				<p> An app that gave <em>accurate</em> bus and metro arrival times would also be great.</p>

				<h2>New Technology &amp; Media Innovations</h2>
				<p><h3>Instagram</h3>
				This app has become the most used social media platform and it was only founded in 2010. I think what sets it apart is that is it purely visual so you can follow and share photos with anyone in world no matter what language they speak. It is hugely popular with young people who are starting to use Facebook less and less (now that their parents want to be their "friends"). </p>
				<p>Instagram is also a very important tool for brands to make use of since many people use it to find out about new products or fashions. If I saw a designer or a blogger that I follow wearing a certain outfit or featuring a product in their home I would be much more likely to go to that brand's page and try to find out more than if I saw it in a magazine ad. It also makes it seem like a more personal and genuine connection because you can comment or ask questions. 
				</p>
				<p><h3> Netflix </h3>
				This video streaming service has completely changed how people consume television shows and how they are produced and aired. Instead of buying a DVD of past episodes you can find them all on your TV and new seasons are available all at once.  Netflix’s endless choices and recommendations based on taste are part of a larger cultural shift towards more customized content for each individual. If you only want to watch romantic comedies with my roommates you can! I’ll be in the other room though. </p>

				<p>Netflix uses data on subscribers’ choices to inform its programming and original content. “House of Cards” was one of their first tests. Netflix found that many people watched both the original BBC version and Kevin Spacey or David Fincher movies, this contributed to the creation of a show that combined those things. This makes me a bit nervous that it will lead to less original content, that new shows will just be an amalgamate of what worked in the past. But, it allowed them to create a very successful show that was specifically tailored to viewers’ interests.</p>

				<p><h3>3D Printer </h3>
				3D printing has been around for many years but it is now becoming much more accessible and well-known. I used a 3D printer in design studio in 2011 and 2012 and even in the short amount of time since then there have been many advancements in the technology. Currently, what 3D printing is used for the most is rapid prototyping and making molds for parts. It allows designers and engineers to test out ideas much faster and cheaper than before. However, 3D printing equipment is becoming much more affordable and soon it may be common to see them in peoples' homes. The exciting thing about that is that you would be able to download digital models and have them made into physical objects right at your desk. With continuing advancements in the types of material that can be printed you could make anything from food to a hat from your computer.
				</p>

				<img src="img/3dprinted.jpg" alt="3D Printed model" width="700px">

				<p>It took about 17 hours to create the white part of this model though so you might have to be patient.</p>

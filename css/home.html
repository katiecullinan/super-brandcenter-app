				<h2>Who I am and what I'm good at</h2>
				<p>I’ve heard that at age 25 the brain is supposed to be fully developed so, having just celebrated my 25th birthday in January, I feel prepared to answer this question. I would say that I am combination of a lot of (sometimes contradictory) things. My favorite colors are black and rainbow. I can meticulously plan a project or jump right in and start testing different ideas. You might find me on the edge of a group just listening or in the middle telling a story. My music collection is equal parts Pet Shop Boys and Led Zeppelin and I might be watching anything from Battlestar Gallactica to The Bachelor (except sports). </p>

				<p>But most of all, I’m curious and love making and learning new things. I’m persistence and become deeply committed to mastering a certain craft or acquiring a skill. I’m happiest when I can experiment and work in both the physical and digital realm, from weaving with yarn to web development. I spent 4 years in architecture school making tiny buildings out of paper, plastic and metal, accidentally gluing cardboard to myself and learning how to use all the woodshop tools and technology that I could.  My experience with model building, web and graphic design and illustration, coupled with skills in creative thinking and problem solving, allow me to quickly express an idea over a wide variety of media. </p>

				<h2>Where I've lived</h2>
				<p><h3>New York, New York</h3>
				Here I learned to walk and talk and color. I enjoyed a short career as a gender-bending baby model where I was first introduced to the world of advertising. You may remember me from a 1991 Fisher Price ad; I played a boy wearing overalls. We moved to the Long Island when I was four but I can still weave through a crowd like a champ.</p>

				<p><h3>Rockville Centre, New York</h3>
				I grew up in this small, dense suburb of Manhattan that is home to more Irish pubs than people. Being about 30 minutes from New York gave me access to an extremely diverse and creative community where I could explore different cultures, art, fashion, music and food. I think this has taught me how to communicate with and work with all kinds of people and be adaptable and open-minded.  I also didn’t learn to drive until I was 22 and I say “talk” like it has a “w” in it. </p>

				<p><h3>Charlottesville, Virginia </h3>
				I came to Charlottesville to study architecture at UVA where I learned to speak a little slower and use power tools on zero hours of sleep. The architecture school was a small close-knit community within the university. I was always surrounded by wonderfully talented teachers and students who challenged me to become a better designer and thinker. There were countless late nights and lots of coffee but also a real sense of community within the school. Everyone helped each other produce their best work.</p> 
				<p> After graduation I started working as a graphic designer at Gropen, Inc., a small design/build company in downtown Charlottesville that makes signs, museum exhibits, plaques and other kinds of environmental graphics. There, I participated in all stages of a collaborative design process and became a more creative and strategic designer. I learned a great deal about effective signage, user experience, fabrication methods and how to convey the client’s message.</p>
	
				<p><h3>Washington, D.C.</h3>
				After living in Charlottesville for a little over a year after school I decided to move to DC for a new job opportunity and a bigger city. I currently work at a boutique marketing and communications agency creating websites, videos, infographics and collateral pieces. Working in small, creative and deadline driven companies has taught me time management, organizational and team-working skills as well as adaptability and critical thinking.</p>
				
				<p>Young people come from all over the world to work in DC so it is a great place for meeting highly driven and motivated people. It has also made me very suspicious of Craigslist roommates. </p>

				<h2>How I got here</h2>
				<p>My path to the Brandcenter evolved from what led me to study architecture in college, wanting to create environments for people.  I want to go to the Brandcenter because I resolutely believe it is the best place for me to learn the skills I need to craft engaging and memorable experience for users by combining design, technology, and branding. To use design and technology to solve problems. I am passionate about creating designs and experiences that are inviting, clear and beautiful.  I think that making a building is similar to designing a website or an app in that you are creating a framework or a tool for people but you cannot totally control how or if they will use it so it’s important that it be appealing and simple to understand. </p>
				<p>I want to build things that will allow users to have a unique experience with a brand or product through technology. People carry around libraries, movie theaters, radios, atlases and sketchbooks everyday and all on one device that is infinitely customizable to their tastes. I want to be able to reach people where they are but also educate and expose them to new things as well as connect digital experiences with physical ones because, everyone could do with some time away from the computer.</p>

				<p>I know a few current and former Brandcenter students; one is Whitney Paul who is in Creative Brand Management, she was in architecture studio with me at UVA.  I’ve also met Alison Murphy (Copywriting) and Andrew Chin (Art Direction ‘14) through friends. </p>
				<p>While I was visiting the Brandcenter in November I had the opportunity to meet Mikaila Weaver who was very friendly and helpful. </p>

				<h2><b>The Principles of Uncertainty</b> by Maira Kalman</h2>
				<p><u>The Principles of Uncertainty</u> is a collection of illustrations and stories that is part diary, sketchbook, travelogue and picture book for adults. To me, it’s about happiness and appreciating the world around you, noticing the little and seemingly insignificant details. Kalman will draw a hat or fruit plate that she saw, making them special and important.  This books lets you see the world through someone else’s eyes and it’s someone who finds delight in abandoned chairs on the sidewalk and old whistles. </p>

				<p>She also describes strangers that she sees in the street, inventing little personal histories for them. This resonated with me as a people watcher because it made me think about how I pass by so many people everyday and they're all thinking their own thoughts and have their own problems and goals but I'll probably never know anything about them. </p>

				<h2>How I've failed</h2>
				
				<p>Two years ago I applied to the Art Direction track at the Brandcenter and I didn’t get in.  I chose Art Direction because I had been working in design and I thought it would be a good fit. I put a great deal of effort into the application and was asked to resubmit part of it but I was ultimately rejected. At first I was very disappointed and upset but I decided I would start looking for a new job to get more education and experience that way. I soon found a new job in D.C. with more design responsibility and I started taking classes in web design and development at night. Getting rejected pushed me to reexamine my goals and as I learned more about technology and experience design I realized that was the track I wanted to pursue.  </p>

				<h2>Alumni stalking</h2>
				<p>Looking at the portfolio sites of CT graduates has definitely become a hobby of mine these past few months. I think what has impressed me the most is the wide range of exciting projects that the graduates worked on while in school and the variety of job titles that they went on to hold. I’ve seen Experience Designers, Interactive Designers and Art Directors, Filmmakers and Copywriters. This is incredibly appealing to me because I would be able to use the combination of technology, strategy, design and innovative thinking taught at the Brandcenter to forge a unique and rewarding career path. </p>

				<h2>Improving with the Internet</h2>
				<p>Everyday at work I create a to-do list for myself. Usually these are just for my own use but every Monday I have to write one for my boss that gives her a general timeline of when I will be sending her something to review. There are a lot of to-do lists out there but something that I would find useful is one that is designed specifically for an office environment and that can be shared among coworkers. It would allow a user to track how long a specific task took so that when he or she needs to do a similar task the next week they would be able to predict how long it will take and map out their day.  </p>

				<p>This program would also allow multiple people who are working together to input their tasks for the day and update their lists when they have completed a task. This would let users to see when their coworkers or collaborators have free time to avoid those “Do you have a minute?” phone calls and interrupting them when they are busiest. An application like this would be especially helpful for someone in a position like mine as the sole creative services person supporting many different people and projects. </p>
